# Colorbind Base Map Description
___________________
My custom base map is modeled after a colorblind color pallet created by Bang Wong and is meant to showcase topography. The custom base map is meant to be able to be viewed by color blind people with protanopia or deuteranopia. When I began my base map project I found this amazing website. This website works as a color-blind simulator so the user can change color swatches and see how they would appear to people with protanopia or deuteranopia. I spent a lot of time messing with the color blind color pallet to make the map as visually appealing as possible to those without color blindness. I made sure to change zoom options on land use, water, roads, and text to give my map dimension. I added a 3D component to my map because I found that it highlighted topography well, which was my focus and goal. Overall this assignment was challenging but I enjoyed the creative aspect.
